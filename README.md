Pocket is Mozilla's popular read-it-later service. Unfortunately, on iOS Pocket only offers a "Discover" widget showing you trending articles; there aren't widgets to show your own favorite (starred) or unread articles. These scripts, deployed through the Scriptable app, bring those missing widgets to your device.

Easy set-up:
* 🧑‍💻 Install the [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app) app by [Simon Støvring](https://github.com/simonbs). 
* 📁 Download the Pocket widget files to your Scriptable folder.
* 😀 Add your Pocket credentials and choose between "Unread" and "Favorites." That's it!

## Usage

You will need a consumer key and access token to query your user data with the Pocket API. To create those credentials:
* Follow the documentation on the [Pocket: Developer API](https://getpocket.com/developer/) site.
* Use one of the many third-party Pocket credential creation tools like [OneClickPocket](http://reader.fxneumann.de/plugins/oneclickpocket/auth.php) or [pocket-auth](https://github.com/mheap/pocket-auth).
